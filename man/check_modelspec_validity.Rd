check_modelspec_validity(modelspecfile)

\description{
The modelspec file specifies the subject directory, paths to the atlas files,
the model specification, whether linear regerssion, correlation etc.
The modelspec file was used in the previous versions of bstr.
Currently, the user does not have to create this explicitly.
This functionality is still kept in case a future need arises to generate these automatically.
