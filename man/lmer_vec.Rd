\title{Vectorized linear mixed-effects regression for brain imaging phenotypes.}
\usage{
lmer_vec(group_var, main_effect = "", covariates = "", bstr_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{group_var}{Categorical variable name. This should be present in the demographics csv file associated
with \code{bstr_data}.}

\item{main_effect}{Character string containing an independent variable whose effect you want to measure.
It could be disease status, age, gender etc. This should strictly be a single variable. This can be
either a categorical or a continuous variable.}

\item{covariates}{Character string containing a set of other predictors (variables) in the model. If more than
one covariates are included, they should be separated by a \code{+} operator similar to an R formula.}

\item{bstr_data}{Object of type \code{\link[=BstrData]{BstrData()}}}
}
\description{
This function accepts a \code{main_effect} and a set of covariates (using the R formula notation) and performs
a linear regression including \code{main_effect + covariates}.
}
\details{
Slightly different from the standard R \code{lmer} function, \code{lmer_vec} currently does not directly accept an R formula.
This could be accomodated in the future versions.
Also currently, this function returns the p-values and the t-statistics for the \code{main_effect}
only. Returning the statistics for all variables could be accomodated in the future versions.
