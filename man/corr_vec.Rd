\title{Vectorized correlation between a variable and brain imaging data.}
\usage{
corr_vec(X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix of dimensions (\eqn{N x T}), where \eqn{N} = number of subjects and \eqn{T} = number of vertices/voxels.}

\item{Y}{vector of length \eqn{N}.}
}
\description{
For most scenarios, the user does not need to call this function directly.
Instead call \code{\link[=bstr_corr]{bstr_corr()}} which calls this function internally.
