\title{Vectorized t-test for for brain imaging phenotypes}
\usage{
ttest_vec(X1, X2, group_var, paired = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1}{matrix of dimensions (\eqn{N1 x T}), where \eqn{N1} = number of subjects and \eqn{T} = number of vertices/voxels.}

\item{X2}{matrix of dimensions (\eqn{N2 x T}), where \eqn{N2} = number of subjects and \eqn{T} = number of vertices/voxels.}

\item{group_var}{Categorical variable name. This should be present in the demographics csv file associated
with \code{bstr_data}.}

\item{paired}{logical; is TRUE if \code{group_var} contains matching (dependent) samples. The default value is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
Perform independent sample and paired sample t-tests between two numerfor differences between means of brain
imaging phenotypes for a categorical variable.
For most scenarios, the user does not need to call this function directly. This function
will be called internally from \code{\link[=bstr_ttest]{bstr_ttest()}}
}
\details{
For an independent samples t-test \eqn{N1} not equal to \eqn{N2}.
For a dependent (paired) samples t-test, \eqn{N1 = N2}.
The degrees of freedom are calculated using the Welchâ€“Satterthwaite approximation by default.
\code{bstr_data} can be of the type "sba", "tbm", or "roi".
