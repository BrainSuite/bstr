\title{Perform analysis of variance (ANOVA) for brain imaging data.}
\usage{
bstr_anova(main_effect = "", covariates = "", bstr_data, mult_comp = "fdr")
}
\arguments{
\item{main_effect}{Character string containing an independent variable whose effect you want to measure.
It could be disease status, age, gender etc. This should strictly be a single variable. This can be
either a categorical or a continuous variable.}

\item{covariates}{Character string containing a set of other predictors (variables) in the model. If more than
one covariates are included, they should be separated by a \code{+} operator similar to an R formula.}

\item{bstr_data}{Object of type \code{\link[=BstrData]{BstrData()}}}

\item{mult_comp}{method for multiple comparisons correction. The default method is "fdr". See \code{\link[=bstr_p_adjust]{bstr_p_adjust()}} for valid values.}
}
\description{
This function accepts a \code{main_effect} and a set of covariates (using the R formula notation) and uses an
F-test to compare the full model including the \code{main_effect + covariates} with the reduced (null) model
that only includes the \code{covariates}.
}
\details{
Slightly different from the standard R anova function, \code{bstr_anova} currently does not directly accept the
results from \code{lm_vec}. This could be accomodated in the future versions.
