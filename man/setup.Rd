\usage{
setup(brainsuite_path = NULL, quiet = FALSE, raise_error = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{brainsuite_path}{path to the BrainSuite installation}

\item{quiet}{logical; if \code{FALSE} does not display messages to the user}

\item{raise_error}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, stops the execution if file does not exist. The default

\description{
This script reads from and writes to the setup configuration file (bstr.ini) for bstr.
Usually this will be called automatically when the package is installed and loaded
for the first time. Optionally, it can be executed by the user immediately after installing bstr.
